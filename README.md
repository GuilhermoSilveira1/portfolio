# 📁 My Developer Portfolio

After a journey of learning and exploring the world of **IT**, the time has finally come to build my own portfolio! 🎉  
In this portfolio, I’ll be showcasing some of the **best projects** I've worked on or developed independently, highlighting my skills and creativity.

The concept behind this portfolio (special thanks to my girlfriend for the amazing idea 💡) is to **emulate the experience of an old-school terminal**, like **MS-DOS**. This retro aesthetic adds a nostalgic and unique feel to the modern technologies that power it!

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

Here’s a list of the technologies and tools that helped bring this project to life:

- **React** (powered by `create-react-app`)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 & CSS3
- react-simple-typewriter (library)

## 🖼️ Preview of the Running Project

Here’s a sneak peek of what the portfolio looks like in action:
